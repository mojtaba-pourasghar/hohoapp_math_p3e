/**
 * What is free, and what needs the subscription.
 *
 * The rules live here, on their own, with no Android in sight: one place to read, one place to
 * change, and a thing that can be checked without a phone. Whether the subscription has been
 * bought is a different question and lives in billing/Entitlement — this class only answers «is
 * this piece inside the free part?».
 *
 * The free part is a real taste of the app, not a locked shop window:
 *
 *   • فصل ۱، بخش ۱ و ۲ — the book pages and the section summary, all of it
 *   • the practice sets of those two sections
 *   • one worksheet and one exam (the easy level of فصل ۱)
 *   • two printable sheets, chosen by the teacher
 *   • every narration clip, since they live on the host and locking them buys nothing
 *
 * Nothing is hidden: a locked piece is still listed, with a 🔒, and tapping it explains why.
